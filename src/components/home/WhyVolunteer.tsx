          In order to become a fully fledged member of Highlander Gloves, you
          will need to volunteer at least twice. Furthermore, volunteering with
          us at RBA is a great thing to include on your resume, an amazing way
          to give back to the community, and most importantly, is a whole lot of
          fun!
